# Introduction to @rhtml

@rhtml (Reactive HyperText Markup Language) is a powerful framework for building modern web applications with a focus on reactive programming, declarative development, and dependency injection. It combines the best practices from various frameworks while maintaining simplicity and flexibility.

## üöÄ Quick Start

The fastest way to get started is by using the official starter template:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rxdi/starter-client-side-lit-html
cd starter-client-side-lit-html
npm install
npm start
```

## üéØ Core Features

1. **Declarative Development**

   - Write components directly in HTML
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Self-documenting structure
   - Monadic approach to component composition

2. **Service Integration**

   - Components as services
   - Clean up after execution
   - Reusable API integrations
   - Dependency injection support

3. **State Management**

   - Built-in state handling
   - Reactive updates
   - Predictable data flow
   - Type-safe state management

4. **Type Safety**

   - Full TypeScript support
   - Compile-time checking
   - IDE autocompletion
   - Runtime type checking

5. **Cross-Platform**
   - Works in both Frontend and Backend
   - Share code between platforms
   - Unified development experience
   - Consistent architecture
